**New design and visual research by [@niels9001](https://github.com/niels9001).**

A terminal user interface for [Windows Package Manager (winget)](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli). Search, install, uninstall, and upgrade Windows packages without leaving your terminal.

## Features

- **Search & Discover** — Find packages across all winget sources
- **Installed Packages** — View everything installed on your system
- **Upgrade Management** — See updates at a glance and batch-upgrade multiple packages
- **Pin Awareness** — Pin or unpin installed packages and filter pinned items without leaving the TUI
- **Source Filtering** — Filter by source (winget, msstore, or all)
- **Sortable Columns** — Sort by Name, ID, or Version (ascending or descending) with `S`
- **Version-Specific Install** — Install a specific version with `I`
- **Package Details** — View publisher, description, license, homepage, and release notes
- **Graceful Local Package Info** — Non-winget installs still show a useful explanation when rich manifest metadata is unavailable
- **Scrollable Details Pane** — Read long descriptions without losing your place in the package list
- **Configurable Startup Defaults** — Set your default view and source in `config.toml`
- **Keyboard-Driven** — Vim-style navigation, no mouse needed
- **Non-Blocking** — Install/uninstall/upgrade run in the background
- **Single Binary** — No runtime dependencies beyond winget itself

## Configuration

You can customize the startup view and source filter with an optional config file:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\winget-tui\config.toml`
- Dev/non-Windows fallback: `$HOME/.config/winget-tui/config.toml`

Example:

```toml
default_view = "upgrades"    # installed | search | upgrades
default_source = "winget"    # all | winget | msstore
```

```

The backend is behind a trait (`WingetBackend`) to allow future implementations (e.g., COM API for better performance).
